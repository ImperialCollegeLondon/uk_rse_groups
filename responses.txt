UCL

30 FTE and growing, breakdown varies over time depending on need, all open-ended, and indirects mean cost recovery >100% (our grants subsidise other activities in the department, and free-at-point-of-use RSE services for researchers)

Southampton

6 RSEs (+2 imminently).  All undertake consultancy + training. 2 (+1 imminently) on open ended, other fixed term.  Cost recovery is 100%.

Bristol

10.5 RSEs. All undertake training. 8.5 on open-ended (subject to funding) contracts and must be fully covered (100% costed as PDRAs on grants - the group is a "postdoc pool" with RSEs costed for a minimum of 6-months/50%). 2 are core-funded (both do consultancy and training); 1 of those is a "free-at-the-point-of-use" RSE who does consultancy and is our loss-leader to get new business and pick up any slack. The other is myself, as the uni recognised that managing the group needs to be core funded. I can be costed on grants so do get some of my salary covered (though there is no expectation of a level). We grow at a rate of approximately 2 RSEs per year.

Exeter

"4 RSEs (+1 more in Dec).
All on projects, with training/teaching responsibilities (still ramping up on this, but will likely be a couple of days a month in total)
All on open-ended contracts
Aiming for 70-80% cost recovery in the original business case, actual figures TBD"

Manchester

26 FTE of RSE with 8 more approved. All open ended. Breakdown is fluid based on work. All take part in training with 1 who focusses and coordinates. cost recovery target 100% but training, apps support and consultancy/loss leaders are core funded and act as the buffer/contingency. Seeing as there's never any shortage on projects we always come in well over 100% in practice and do little-to-no loss leaders as a result.

Sheffield

"~13
All on projects with some 50% on Tier 2 support, small amounts of training and other free at point of use
All on open ended
Aiming for ~80%"

Oxford

7 RSEs (+2 hopefully soon), 85% projects / 15% teaching (teaching varies with demand, but its mostly via a project we have with a DTC), all on fixed-term 1 year contracts that get renewed each year, cost recovery is > 100% thanks to overheads
"this is excluding the Cambridge Open Exascale Lab, which is just ramping up, so covers the core team including one new starter)

Cambridge

Total number of FTEs: 6
projects/consultancy: 6 , teaching/training: 0  (although we are pursuing Nvida and Intel certifications and will be doing more training in the future)
open ended: 5, fixed term: 1 (the COEL will skew that because all those posts will be 2 yr fixed term)
Cost recovery: 90%"

Newcastle

"15 FTE total
13 FTE chargeable to projects, 1.5 for management and 0.5 for training coordinator
roughly 2/3 on fixed term, the rest open-ended. This is to do with length of service; after a period of time staff transition to open-ended, this is a University wide policy.
Cost recovery target is 80% but in reality we recover 100% because there's always work to be done. Different from most other groups, we run a facility model with a flat day rate to recover our true cost"

Birmingham

"Total number of FTEs: 11
Breakdown of FTE's according to projects/consultancy (6 FTE) , teaching/training (~0.5 FTE) and other (~3 FTE HPC etc. support, ~1 FTE automation/systems/process support, ~0.5 FTE management)
Breakdown of FTE's according to open-ended (7 FTE) or fixed-term contract (4 FTE - with hopes to make them all open-ended)
If relevant, team's cost recovery target (%): We aim to recover the cost of 2.5 FTE, and tend to do more than this as we do some funded work from others in the team too."

Durham

"Total number of FTEs   3.8  - Currently recruiting additional 4 RSEs
Breakdown of FTE's according to projects/consultancy, teaching/training and other
Approximately 80% on projects 5% training 15% on other
Breakdown of FTE's according to open-ended or fixed-term contract
4 on open-ended contract. New recruits on 3-year contract with the objective that they will become permanent before contract ends.
If relevant, team's cost recovery target (%)
3 x FTE are core funded but objective that all contracts are funded for cost recovery to allow additional recruitment"
